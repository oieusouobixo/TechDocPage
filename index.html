        <p>PWAs are web apps developed using a number of specific technologies and standard patterns to allow them to take advantage of both web and native app features.</p>
        <p>For example, web apps are more discoverable — it's a lot easier and faster to visit a website than install an application, and you can also share web apps via a link.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, native apps are better integrated with the operating system and therefore offer a more seamless experience for the users. You can install a native app so that it works offline, and users love tapping their homescreen icons to easily access their favorite apps, rather than navigating to it using a browser.</p>
        <p>PWAs give us the ability to create web apps that can enjoy these same advantages.</p>
        <p>It's not a brand new concept — such ideas have been revisited many times on the web platform with various approaches in the past. Progressive Enhancement and responsive design already allow us to build mobile friendly websites. Working offline and installing apps was possible in the Firefox OS ecosystem a few years ago.</p>
        <p>PWAs, however, provide all this and more, without getting rid of any of the existing features that make the web great.</p>        
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="What_makes_an_app_a_PWA">
        <header>What makes an app a PWA</header>
        <p>As we hinted at above, PWAs are not created with a single technology. They represent a new philosophy for building web apps, involving some specific patterns, APIs, and other features. It's not that obvious if a web app is a PWA or not from first glance. An app could be considered a PWA when it meets certain requirements, or implements a set of given features: works offline, is installable, is easy to synchronize, can send push notifications, etc.</p>
        <p>In addition, there are tools to measure the completeness of an app in percentages. (Lighthouse is currently the most popular one.) By implementing various technological advantages, we can make an app more progressive, thus ending up with a higher Lighthouse score. But this is only a rough indicator.</p>
        <p>There are some key principles a web app should try to observe to be identified as a PWA. It should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Discoverable">Discoverable</a>, so the contents can be found through search engines.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Installable">Installable</a>, so it's available on the device's home screen.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Linkable">Linkable</a>, so you can share it by simply sending a URL. </li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Network_independent">Network independent</a>, so it works offline or with a poor network connection.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Progressive">Progressive</a>, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest ones.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Re-engageable">Re-engageable</a>, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Responsive">Responsive</a>, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browser — mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, fridges, etc.</li>
          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Advantages#Safe">Safe</a>, so the connection between you and the app is secured against any third parties trying to get access to your sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Architecture_of_an_app">
        <header>Architecture of an app</header>
        <p>There are two main, different approaches to rendering a website — on the server or on the client. They both have their advantages and disadvantages, and you can mix the two approaches to some degree.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server-side rendering (SSR) means a website is rendered on the server, so it offers quicker first load, but navigating between pages requires downloading new HTML content. It works great across browsers, but it suffers in terms of time navigating between pages and therefore general perceived performance — loading a page requires a new round trip to the server.</li>
          <li>Client-side rendering (CSR) allows the website to be updated in the browser almost instantly when navigating to different pages, but requires more of an initial download hit and extra rendering on the client at the beginning. The website is slower on an initial visit, but can be faster to navigate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mixing SSR with CSR can lead to the best results — you can render a website on the server, cache its contents, and then update the rendering on the client-side as and when needed. The first page load is quick because of the SSR, and the navigation between pages is smooth because the client can re-render the page with only the parts that have changed.</p>
        <p>PWAs can be built using any approach you like, but some will work better than the others. The most popular approach is the "app shell" concept, which mixes SSR and CSR in exactly the way described above, and in addition follows the "offline first" methodology which we will explain in detail in upcoming articles and use in our example application. There is also a new approach involving the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API">Streams API</a>, which we'll mention briefly.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Service_workers_in_the_js13kPWA_app">
        <header>Service workers in the js13kPWA app</header>
        <p>Enough theory — let's see some source code!</p>
        <h1>Registering the Service Worker</h1>
        <p>We'll start by looking at the code that registers a new Service Worker, in the app.js file: </p>
        <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: We're using the <a href="http://es6-features.org/">es6</a> <strong>arrow functions</strong> syntax in the Service Worker Implementation</p>
        <pre><code>if('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./pwa-examples/js13kpwa/sw.js');
};</code></pre>
        <p>If the service worker API is supported in the browser, it is registered against the site using the <code>ServiceWorkerContainer.register()</code> method. Its contents reside in the sw.js file, and can be executed after the registration is successful. It's the only piece of Service Worker code that sits inside the app.js file; everything else that is Service Worker-specific is written in the sw.js file itself.</p>
        <h1>Lifecycle of a Service Worker</h1>
        <p>When registration is complete, the sw.js file is automatically downloaded, then installed, and finally activated.</p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>The API allows us to add event listeners for key events we are interested in — the first one is the <mark style="background-color: lightgray">install</mark> event:</p>
        <pre><code>self.addEventListener('install', (e) => {
    console.log('[Service Worker] Install');
});</code></pre>
        <p>In the <mark style="background-color: lightgray">install</mark> listener, we can initialize the cache and add files to it for offline use. Our js13kPWA app does exactly that.</p>
        <p>First, a variable for storing the cache name is created, the app shell files are listed in one array.</p>
        <pre><code>var cacheName = 'js13kPWA-v1';
var appShellFiles = [
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/index.html',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/app.js',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/style.css',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/fonts/graduate.eot',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/fonts/graduate.ttf',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/fonts/graduate.woff',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/favicon.ico',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/img/js13kgames.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/img/bg.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-32.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-64.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-96.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-128.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-168.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-192.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-256.png',
  '/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-512.png'
];</code></pre>
        <p>Next, the links to images to be loaded along with the content from the data/games.js file are generated in the second array. After that, both arrays are merged using the <mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>Array.prototype.concat()</code></mark> function.</p>
        <pre><code>var gamesImages = [];
for(var i=0; i&lt;games.length; i++) {
  gamesImages.push('data/img/'+games[i].slug+'.jpg');
}
var contentToCache = appShellFiles.concat(gamesImages);</code></pre>
        <p>Then we can manage the <mark style="background-color: lightgray">install</mark> event itself:</p>
        <pre><code>self.addEventListener('install', (e) => {
  console.log('[Service Worker] Install');
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open(cacheName).then((cache) => {
          console.log('[Service Worker] Caching all: app shell and content');
      return cache.addAll(contentToCache);
    })
  );
});</code></pre>
        <p>There are two things that need an explanation here: what <mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>ExtendableEvent.waitUntil</code></mark> does, and what the <mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>caches</code></mark> object is.</p>
        <p>The service worker does not install until the code inside <mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>waitUntil</code></mark> is executed. It returns a promise — this approach is needed because installing may take some time, so we have to wait for it to finish.</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>caches</code></mark> is a special <mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>CacheStorage</code></mark> object available in the scope of the given Service Worker to enable saving data — saving to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">web storage</a> won't work, because web storage is synchronous. With Service Workers, we use the Cache API instead.</p>
        <p>Here, we open a cache with a given name, then add all the files our app uses to the cache, so they are available next time it loads (identified by request URL).</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Updates">
        <header>Updates</header>
        <p>There is still one point to cover: how do you upgrade a Service Worker when a new version of the app containing new assets is available? The version number in the cache name is key to this:</p>
        <code>var cacheName = 'js13kPWA-v1';</code>
        <p>When this updates to v2, we can then add all of our files (including our new files) to a new cache:</p>
        <pre><code>contentToCache.push('/pwa-examples/js13kpwa/icons/icon-32.png');

// ...

self.addEventListener('install', (e) => {
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open('js13kPWA-v2').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll(contentToCache);
    })
  );
});</code></pre>
        <p>A new service worker is installed in the background, and the previous one (v1) works correctly up until there are no pages using it — the new Service Worker is then activated and takes over management of the page from the old one.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Clearing_the_cache">
        <header>Clearing the cache</header>
        <p>Remember the <mark style="background-color: lightgray"><code>activate</code></mark> event we skipped? It can be used to clear out the old cache we don't need anymore:</p>
        <pre><code>self.addEventListener('activate', (e) => {
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then((keyList) => {
          return Promise.all(keyList.map((key) => {
        if(key !== cacheName) {
          return caches.delete(key);
        }
      }));
    })
  );
});</code></pre>
        <p>This ensures we have only the files we need in the cache, so we don't leave any garbage behind; the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Browser_storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria">available cache space in the browser is limited</a>, so it is a good idea to clean up after ourselves.</p>
